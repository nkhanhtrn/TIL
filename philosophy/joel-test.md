# Joel Test

Joel Test is a famous checklist made by Joel Spolsky. The test contains 12 checklist items that usually used to rate the quality of a software team:

1. Do you use source control?
2. Can you make a build in one step?
3. Do you make daily builds?
4. Do you have a bug database?
5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
6. Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
7. Do you have a spec?
8. Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
9. Do you use the best tools money can buy?
10. Do you have testers?
11. Do new candidates write code during their interview?
12. Do you do hallway usability testing? 

If all answers return `yes` then you maintained a really good software team. For more about the test, you can read it [here] (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)
